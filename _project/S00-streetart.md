![Boston's very own Downtown Crossing.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/streetart/downtown.jpg)

This summer I was working as a remote web developer in Boston. Without the regular hours of an office, I found my schedule slipping into the early AMs, and then the late AMs. I also started to feel quite isolated. I decided that I needed to do something that:

> 1. required lots of socializing,
> 2. would get me outside during the day, and
> 3. would help me improve at something I was interested in.

I decided to be a portrait artist, like the ones I used to idolize as a kid in Times Square. It fulfilled all conditions easily. That afternoon, I picked up:
> - Two camping seats. Small enough to fold and put into my bag. One for me, one for my customer.
> - A canvas stand. Not to use for drawing, but to hold up my sign.
> - A drawing pad, 18" x 24". Again, not for actual drawing but to use as my sign.
> - A bucket hat and sunscreen.

Filled with trepidation and excitement, I stepped out of the Red Line station into Boston's Downtown Crossing. And so began my life as a street artist.

> ## FAQ

**How much money did you make?**

Haha. This is always the first question. I initially charged $10 a portrait but messaged it as a suggested donation. This means that a third of people who really like their portraits will pay me $20 or more. The most I got paid was $100 (true [80/20 curve](https://www.8020curve.com/instructions.html) in action). For simplification, let's say this is $15/portrait. 

A portrait takes me 15 minutes. Given a chit-chat time of 5 minutes per person, this caps me at 3 portraits per hour, or $45/hour...assuming that people are lining up to get drawn.

But people aren't lining up to be drawn. Musicians and breakdancers can draw crowds with their energy and showmanship. Artist don't have the same option. My best bet is try to engage people to make them stop, making other people stop in the process. I didn't figure this part out until after a painful first week.

But anyways. Here are some stats from week 1:

Not so great, huh? I was bummed too. 

Here from week 7:

A lot better!

Short answer: Enough to pay the rent. 

Long answer: I was surprised that after the first week I was making a livable income. After I had learned my initial lessons though, my hourly revenue didn't change very much. By FAR the most meaningful change I made was upping my suggested donation from $10 to $20, and using a thicker, more official looking card-stock material.

I also acknowledge there were a number of optimizations I could have made. A larger, printed sign. More examples of my work. Portraits on canvases that could sell for $40. Mass-produced pop art canvases on the side. I wanted to stay light though, so I go move around and do things after I was done working. That meant everything had to fit in my bag. 

One could argue that you don't do something like this for the money. From talking to the other street performers though, I get the sense that it is purely for the money, because it allows them pursue their art on the side without the obligation of employment. This brings me to the next question:

**Make any friends?**

I would frequently see [The Human DJ](https://www.instagram.com/thehumandj/), one of the more popular street performers in Boston. He told me it was the quickest way to make money for now, and as soon as he saved enough, he would transition to making his own music full time.

It was the same for [Mr. Not Art](http://www.mettermedia.com/not-art-x-metter-media-interview/). A grafitti artist, he sold his prints on the street while working on his own pieces in the meantime. He's been doing the same concept for 7 years now, and is having a hard time coming up with something new.

**Who gets their portrait drawn?**

I realized early on that my drawing style wasn't popular with the tourist families I got more young people with creative, niche interests, and a lot more locals. I had lots of people who said they liked to draw too and wished they kept at it.

**Any interesting people out there?**

Oh gosh. Plenty. Lot of weirdos. Lot of nice weirdos. Some kids who worked at a nearby Primark would stop by every day and shill for me. They were fun.

**Was it fun?**

It was fun to talk to people and get paid. It wasn't fun doing the actual portraits. It's pretty mentally taxing to go for accuracy with a time constraint.

I thought of it as free drawing practice, which made the whole thing go more smoothly.

**Worst Experience?**

Dirtbike teenagers hanging out on the street all evening and scaring all my customers away with the noise.

Or, that customer that walked off without giving the "suggested donation". Haha.

<figure class="ph5-ns ph4 mw6 pb3 center"><img class="mb4" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/streetart/kid.jpg"></figure>

**Any tips for aspiring street artists?**

Experiment with times and locations. I thought I would to better in Faneuil Hall, Boston's most touristy spot, but I rarely got any customers when I set up there (there was also more established competition).

The evenings on the weekends worked best for me. This was when things were slowing down, and it was starting to get dark. Thursdays were always better than Fridays.

Your mood can get get low easily when you've get stretches without customers. It's okay to take a a break, buy some water, sit down, and do some light sketching while you get your energy back. I found that chatting with strangers without the intent of drawing them was always a mood boost.

And don't forget: you have the ability to make someone's day :)
