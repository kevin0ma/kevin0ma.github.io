![Grave of a dead writer.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/streetart/henry.jpg)

I'm writing this from a nice little pizza place in Concord, MA. The town is the site of Thoreau's Walden Pond. A ton of very literary people have lived and worked here. I had a fun morning vistiting the graves of dead writers.

Anyways, I ramble when I first start writing and have no ideas. It gets me flowing. I'll get to the point. It's been a strange two months, and here's why.

 I was working as a remote web developer in Boston. Without the regular hours of an office, I found my schedule slipping into the early AMs, and then the late AMs. I also started to feel quite isolated. I decided that I needed to do something that required socializing and that would give me a semblance of a normal schedule. 

I decided to be a portrait artist, like the ones I used to idolize as a kid in Times Square. That afternoon, I picked up:
> - Two camping seats. Small enough to fold and put into my bag. One for me, one for my customer.
> - A canvas stand. Not to use for drawing, but to hold up my sign.
> - A drawing pad, 18" x 24". Again, not for actual drawing but to use as my sign.
> - A bucket hat and sunscreen.

Filled with trepidation and excitement, I stepped out of the Red Line station into Boston's Downtown Crossing. And so began my life as a street artist.

> ## FAQ

**How much money did you make?**

Haha. This is always the first question. I charge $10 a portrait but message it as a suggested donation. This means that a third of people who really like their portraits will pay me $20 or more (true [80/20 curve](https://www.8020curve.com/instructions.html) in action). For simplification, let's say this is $13.33/portrait. 

A portrait takes me 15 minutes. Given a chit-chat time of 5 minutes per person, this caps me at 3 portraits per hour, or $40/hour...assuming that people are lining up to get drawn.

But people aren't lining up to be drawn. Musicians and breakdancers can draw crowds with their energy and showmanship. Artist don't have the same option. My best bet is try to engage people to make them stop, making other people stop in the process. I didn't figure this part out until after a painful first week.

But anyways. Here's profit from week 1:

Not so great, huh? I was bummed too. 

Here's profit from week 7: 


A lot better!

Short answer: Enough to pay the rent. 

Long answer: Not enough for the time I put in to be worth it. One could argue that you don't do something like this for the money. From talking to every street performer though, I get the sense that it is purely for the money, and it lets them pursue their art on the side. This brings me to the next question:

**Make any friends?**

I would frequently see [The Human DJ](https://www.instagram.com/thehumandj/), one of the more popular street performers in Boston. He told me it was the quickest way to make money for now, and as soon as he saved enough, he would transition to making his own music full time.

It was the same for [Mr. Not Art](http://www.mettermedia.com/not-art-x-metter-media-interview/). A grafitti artist, he sold his prints on the street while working on his own pieces in the meantime. He's been doing the same concept for 7 years now, and is having a hard time coming up with something new.

**Who gets their portrait drawn?**

I realized early on that my drawing style wasn't popular with the tourist families that like to get portraits of their kids. I got more young people with creative, niche-y interests, and more locals. I had lots of people who said they liked to draw too and wished they kept at it. There were more women than men.

**Any interesting people out there?**

Oh gosh. Plenty. Lot of weirdos. Lot of nice weirdos. Some kids who worked at a nearby Primark would stop by every day and shill for me. They were fun.

**Was it fun?**

It was fun to talk to people and get paid. It wasn't fun doing the actual portraits. It's pretty mentally taxing to go for accuracy with a time constraint.

I thought of it as free drawing practice, which made the whole thing go more smoothly. 

**Any tips for aspiring street artists?**

Experiment with times and locations. I thought I would to better in Faneuil Hall, Boston's most touristy spot, but I rarely got any customers when I set up there (there was also more established competition).

The evenings on the weekends worked best for me. This was when things were slowing down, and it was starting to get dark. Thursdays were always better than Fridays.

Your mood can get get low easily when you've get stretches without customers. It's okay to take a a break, buy some water, sit down, and do some light sketching while you get your energy back. I found that chatting with strangers without the intent of drawing them always helped my mood, and sometimes they would become customers.
