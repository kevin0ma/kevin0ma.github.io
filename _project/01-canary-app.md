description: "Over the years, the Canary app went from supporting a single device to multiple devices in multiple locations with multiple users. As new features were rapidly shipped, they were forced into design paradigms which didn't suit them.<br><br>I rethought and redesigned parts of the core experience from the ground up, to better accomodate how people use Canary today.
