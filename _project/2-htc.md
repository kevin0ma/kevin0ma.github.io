Emotar is a mobile app by HTC R&D, that aims to help users create personalized stickers for instant messaging apps. I was fortunate to be given autonomy over some features, and worked with programmers and a project manager to ship the subsequent version. Weekly critiques with the design team helped me stay focused on design goals.
