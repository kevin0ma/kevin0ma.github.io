I worked as a Software Design Intern at IBM before my senior year of school. The work was for yet to be released, so I will omit discussion.

At a high level, I worked with a team of interns and designers to build a product from the ground up. The process involved meetings with both stakeholders and clients.

# On Design Systems
The internship got me thinking about design systems.

Design systems became quite trendy in 2016. In the simplest sense a design system refers to a set of instructions which can be used to design multiple products.

IBM's design system is the eponymous [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/). I found this design system enjoyable to work with. By adhering to the rules, I saved time that otherwise would have went towards repeated styling of the same elements. The language also ensured consistency throughout the products that were coming from different product teams.

Yet, I kept on running into corner-cases, in which sticking to the rules would have confounded the user.

The choice was unattractive either way:

  1. Deviate from the system with an ad-hoc design. The gatekeepers of design purity will cry foul, users will be grateful.
  2. Keep consistent. The experience is unified. Hopefully the result won't be too problematic.

We love to systemize things. We don't want to confuse our users by coming up with something different for every problem. Dictating a design system at the start however, can reveal local gaps that the system doesn't cover.

I think the solution yet-to-be-seen, and remains rather nebulous. I saw a peek under the hood of what designers were doing on the Design Language team and it's fascinating. What's required is a gradual shift from aesthetic components to behavioral ones.
