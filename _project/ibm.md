I had the privilege of working as a Software Design Intern at IBM Design before my senior year of school. As the work was for yet to be released products, I am unable to discuss all of the things I got to work on.

At a high level, I worked with a team of interns and designers to built a product from the ground up to ship. The process involved meetings with stakeholders, interviewing IBM clients, and cross collaboration with developers and project managers. It was the first time that I had worked on a project that had so many different stakeholders; I learned how important it is to keep everybody in the loop.

# Critiquing Design Systems
The internship got my thinking about the way design systems are used, or more importantly, not used.

Design systems became quite trendy in 2016. They refers to the philosophy which encourages designers to define a set of instructions that can be used to design multiple products.

IBM's design system is the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/). The benefits of working with the language quickly became apparent as I began to work with it. By adhering to strict rules, I could save time that otherwise may have went towards repeated styling of the same elements. The language also ensured consistency throughout the products that were coming from different product teams.
