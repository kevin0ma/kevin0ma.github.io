    <div class="fn fl-l w-50-l w-100"><p class="mt0-ns f3 lh-copy"> first thing I did after graduating college was turn down a job offer and go hitchhiking. I also wound up working a couple of odd jobs, most of which were decent.

Here’s what people were most interested asking about. </p></div>

Is it safe?
</p>
<p class="f4 fw4 lh-copy">
It was much safer and easier than I expected it to be. That being said, there are risks that you are aware of and accept going in.

Where did you go?

<p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy">
How do you do it?
</p>
<p class="f4 fw5 lh-copy">
In most states, it’s illegal to hitchhike on the highway, even though I saw many people who did it anyways. The common advice, and what worked best for me, was to stand before the highway ramp.

Who picks up hitchhikers?
All different kinds! You have your Jehovah’s witnesses , Scientologists.

Really though, it was all different types. Young, old, male, female all stopped. People that normally like to help people.

Where did you sleep?
In true road style I had a sleeping bag that went into a bright orange survival bivvy, and I’d put a blow up camping pad underneath. I would get a tent the next time, your face gets pretty cold sleeping under the stars.

What did you eat? 
Mainly gas station food.

Tips for hitchhikers?
Be friendly.
