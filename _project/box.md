Jeremy Cytryn, Natalie Diebold, Will Peck and Sam Chen

# Background

 We built a puzzle game over the course of a semester for the class Analytics-based Game Design. We would release a version of the game every month, and iterate based upon collected analytics and user feedback. I was responsible for level, experience, and visual design.

 Along the way, we ran into a number of challenges, both design and technical. One of the more difficult design problems was teaching the player how to play the game. Playing the game well required not only understanding of controls, but how to manipulate the 3D world. We experimented with a number of level-design techniques to create a challenging, but manageable learning curve.
