*During the second half of 2018, I led the redesign of Canary’s native mobile apps, giving users a faster and more convenient way to protect their homes.*

**My Responsibilities** I did all prototyping, visual and interaction design. I was a contributor to strategy, planning and testing.

**Full Time Team**

Maciej Szelazek - Product Manager

Michael Klein - Senior Engineer

Michael Schroeder - Engineer

**Contributors**

Marc DeBartholomeis - Brand Design

Subashiny Gengatharan - Product Manager

**This was an incredibly rewarding project to be a part of. It involved a small team, resulted in pushing forward a number of tangential projects, and helped us solidify our design language.**

### INTRO

- When the Canary app was released in 2014, it was by the built with the assumption that a user only had one camera, only had one location they wanted to place cameras in, and only.
- The Canary team was forced to tack new features on the end rather than build a wholistic solutions.
- Our app reviews became flooded with complaints about the unintuitive UI.
- With the mobile app being so broad (5 core areas of functionality), what areas should we focus on first? How could we create a roadmap to eventually tackle all areas?

My colleague Maciej led a series of interviews with UK and US customers, finding about how they worked, when and where they checked their Canaries, their attitudes towards smart home security, day to day schedules.

### **What we wanted to learn**

- What were our customers' attitudes towards security devices, and how did they engage with them in their day to day lives.

- What did customers perceive as critical functionality? How could we enhance our whole ecosystem, consisting of a web and mobile app, rather than simply replicate existing functionality?

- What are the business opportunities of an improved app experience? How could an improved mobile offering better position our subscription services, at a time when our business is transitioning from a hardware sales company to a SAAS company?

- What was our competition offering, and what did people think of it? Were people using other security cameras like Nest because Canary wasn’t meeting their requirements in a mobile context? What mistakes of theirs could we learn from?

### Insights

**Make mental models model use**

The entire app navigation is based on an established hierarchy for Locations, Devices and Users. Users and Devices belong to Locations. The existing app and navigation reflect this hierarchy: paged cards show different locations and the settings for their parts.

Most users didn't know this. It doesn't make sense, when:

- 95.9% of owners only have 1 location
- 85% of locations have 1 device

How could we arrange devices, locations and users to aid the user in their understanding?

**Show me status**

The dashboard is the central view of the app. Every camera has it's own dashboard. This raises the problem of having to navigate to different cameras. While customers could figure this out, it took a few tries and false starts.

But a user's mindset when entering the app isn't necessarily let me check my camera right now. It's more: "I hope nothing bad has happened". There's an emotional arc of tension and release.

What if all cameras could be presented within the same view? A view that could show other information which may be pertinent to a user entering the app, such as events that have recently taken place.

**Set it and forget it**

Because of the way the app came to be designed, settings became tucked into sub-sub-menus, and UI patterns were chosen within the rigid constraints of what had already been built.

How could we put the settings that our users were looking for at the forefront, without the confusing hierarchy that we had built?

### Planning it all out.

Given that we were sandwiched between multiple projects, I was asking myself: how can we roll this design out in multiple "pieces" that don't interrupt the flow of the other pieces in the ecosystem?

I began sketching out some of the key views, workflows and interactions, trying to find common patterns and behaviour.

<figure class="ph3-s mw7 pb3 center"><img class="mb4" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/canaryapp/experiences.png"></figure>

Design is so often a weird game of push and pull. Knowing when to stay fast and keep experimenting, versus knowing when to slow down and be more methodical — then finding the right tools for each scenario. I try not to labour over an idea in a single tool or medium for too long; instead just get the answer I need and move on.

At this point in the process I was using pen and paper as the quickest possible way to test ideas out, before continually hopping in and out of different digital tools to test how layouts, workflows, or interaction patterns actually felt in higher fidelity. When I thought a particular execution was working, I’d get it into other people’s hands for quick and dirty task-based tests.

I chose to focus on the core Dashboard first: how this experiences changed would affect the rest of the app. When a new design pattern was showing promise, I’d try it out in different scenarios, with information, or in different sections. If needed, I’d make a quick interaction prototype before returning to pen and paper or Figma. As the library of patterns and conventions began to grow, the app began to take shape.

###Design milestones###

A few key things that happened during the design process

**Complexity can be reduced greatly**

<figure class="ph4-ns ph3 mw9 pb3 center"><img class="mb4" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/canaryapp/condense.jpg"></figure>

Take this example. By condensing the views into a single view, we present the options with much greater clarity that if they had been spread on different screens.

<figure class="ph4-ns ph3 mw7 pb3 center"><img class="mb4" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/canaryapp/settings.jpg"></figure>

To be able to perform an action however, doesn’t mean that one understands it. We noticed users searching every menu to find what they were looking for.

We grouped settings by their type: were they a shared setting or an individual setting? The distinction let us group related settings. Want to turn off your camera notifications? Everything is a tap away from the top level now.

**And so it goes...**

At the end of 2018, Canary was acquired by German IOT company Smartfrog. The app we built never made it into the hands of our customers, but I'm proud of the work we did and grateful for the opportunity. I'd like to thank the Canary team for all of their support. And thanks to Sam and Jac for the feedback, and for keeping me honest.
