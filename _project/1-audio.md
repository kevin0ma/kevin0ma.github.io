Recently I’ve been listening to audiobooks on my commute home. They’re convenient, portable, and a stranger reads them to you in a warm voice filled with inflection. Yet, I feel like they're missing something.

The feeling comes from the habit of marking up my physical books. Mostly I’ll underline words and tidbits that jump out to me. I wondered if there be an analogous experience with audio.

I tackled the question with Audiobit, an audiobook app that focuses on interaction with the audio.
