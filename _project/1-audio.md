###### I can't interact with an audiobook like I can with a physical book. This makes it harder to learn.

### Listen
The audio player: built around bookmarking without obstructing the experience of listening.

### Engage
Editing a bookmark is immersive and easy - add notes or change the audio duration on the go.

### Repeat, anytime
Bookmarks are a swipe away. Come back to them during listening, or afterwards.


## Getting there
Engaging with audio is a nebulous concept. I had a number of questions to answer to clarify my problem space:

- Why would you want to engage, or not engage with an audiobook?
- Who would want to engage with an audiobook?
- What is the context of listening?

Interviewing a variety of audiobook listeners about their needs and habits allowed me to:
1. Confirm the idea was relevant.
2. Provide me with possible scenarios in which the app was used.
3. Help me figure out who I was designing for.

I focused the design around people who were trying to learn, and investigated the relationship between interaction and learning.

I synthesized the results of my research into design goals to guide my process. I hoped to build something that would:

- Encourage active engagement while listening
- Allow for fast revisiting during, and after listening
- Tell me what I haven't revisited

<!-- Key insights:
- People make learning "artifacts" to keep themselves engaged.
- Passive reminders keep relevant information. -->

<!-- - People think of audio in complete blocks. They're used to interactions with entire blocks (eg. favoriting a song) and aren't so used interacting with increments of audio.
- Audiobooks are a very hands off. The only times that people might interrupt a listening experience are to rewind if they missed something. -->

Testing with users led to several interaction changes. For example, users found the bookmarks disconnected from the audio player. I tried some versions before arriving at the successful paged version.
