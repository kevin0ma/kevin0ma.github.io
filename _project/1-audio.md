### A People Problem
I can't interact with audiobooks the same I can with a physical book. This makes it difficult to revisit the material to supplement my understanding.

To kick off the research process, I looked into the ways people interacted with material they were learning. I observed that people made artifacts of learning that they used to do the following: 1. Consume once, 2. Reuse again and again, 3. Share or 4. Do nothing.

<div style="
    margin-left: -30%;
    margin-right: -30%;
">
<video loop width="100%" name="Demo" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/audio/paged_demo.mp4" autoplay="autoplay"></video>
</div>

Based upon the research, I established that one of the primary design goals would be to support revisiting on the go, as well as after listening. To that end, I prototyped a number of different formats for the audio player. Paged scrolling, though unconventional, was well received by users.

The audio player itself is built around the bookmarking action. A new bookmark indicator encourages users to listen to segments that they've interacted with.

Editing a bookmark is immersive and easy - users can add notes or change the audio duration on the go.
