Recently I’ve been listening to audiobooks on my commute home. They’re convenient, portable, and a stranger reads them to you in a warm voice filled with inflection. Yet, I feel like they're missing something.

The feeling comes from the habit of marking up my physical books. Mostly I’ll underline words and tidbits that jump out to me. Occasionally, my own ramblings make their way into the margins. Could there be an analogous experience with audio?

I tackled the question with Audiobit, an audiobook app that focuses on interacting with audio.
