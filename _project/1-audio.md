Recently I’ve been listening to audiobooks on my commute home. They’re convenient, portable, and read to you in a warm voice filled with inflection. What more could be desired?

I have the habit of marking up my books. Mostly I’ll underline words and tidbits that jump out to me. Occasionally, my own notes will make their way into the margins. With this habit comes a newfound attention to marks made by others. The accumulated scribblings within second or tenth-hand books are like little dialogues unbidden by time and space.

Audiobit is an app that aims to bring the experience of making notes in a physical book into the audiobook.
