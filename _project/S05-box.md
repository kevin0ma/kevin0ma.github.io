### Team

Kevin Ma, [Jeremy Cytryn](http://www.jeremycytryn.com/), Natalie Diebold, Will Peck and [Renchu Song](http://renchusong.github.io/portfolio/)

### Background

We built a puzzle game over the course of a semester for the class Analytics-based Game Design. Our process: we'd release a version of the game every month, collect a ton of data and user feedback, and then iterate. I was responsible for level, experience, and visual design.

Flixel, the library we used for programming, has no 3D capabilities. This meant making the game was every much a design challenge as a technical one. I was largely occupied by the problem of teachingâ€”not only teaching game controls, but also the larger concept of navigating across a cube.

### Outcome
A fun game with a challenging, but carefully calibrated learning curve. The game garnered over 100,000 players across a few flash game websites, and was eventually reviewed by games aggregator <a href="https://jayisgames.com/review/box.php">Jay is Games</a>.
