# Background

The HR Department of Cornell Research needed a new digital home — one that welcomed its employees, rather than confuse them.

Research Division employees and managers came to the existing site with a number of tasks in mind: finding forms, completing checklists for on-boarding new hires, looking for upcoming events, finding information about retirement benefits.

The department hoped to create a platform that would make finding this information more intuitive. I closely worked with HR staff to create a site that prioritized the needs of its people. I was responsible for both design and development.


# Outcome

A fully-responsive web application. The pages are built upon modules of functionality, which allow for the site to be scaled as time goes on and processes are continually updated.
