<p>The HR Department of Cornell Research needed a new digital homeâ€Šâ€”â€Šone that welcomed its employees, rather than confuse them.</p>

<p>Research Division employees and managers came to the existing site with a number of tasks in mind: finding forms, completing checklists for on-boarding new hires, looking for upcoming events, finding information about retirement benefits.</p>

<p>The department hoped to create a platform that would make finding this information more intuitive. I closely worked with HR staff to create a site that prioritized the needs of its people. I was responsible for both design and development.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p>A fully-responsive web application. The pages are built upon modules of functionality, which allow for the site to be scaled as time goes on and processes are continually updated.</p>
