I"ˇ<p><em>I want to be a writer, so I‚Äôm going to brainstorm some ideas.</em></p>

<p><em>I want to be a visual artist, so I‚Äôm going to think of things to draw.</em></p>

<p><em>I want a significant other, so I‚Äôm going to look for people to date.</em></p>

<p><em>I want to make a business, so I‚Äôm going develop a product.</em></p>

<p>This is how we‚Äôre trained from childhood. To visualize outcomes, set goals, and then take the necessary steps to achieve them.</p>

<p>This approach works, otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt teach it. But not in all of the ways that we think.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I have always found my creative and business pursuits to to be more enjoyable, satisfying, and successful if I went about them the exact opposite way:</p>

<p><em>This idea that is so compelling that I must write it down.</em></p>

<p><em>I wonder how this would look like. I have to draw it.</em></p>

<p><em>This person is fantastic. I would love to see them more often.</em></p>

<p><em>People love this thing that I do for fun. Hey, I could charge for this.</em></p>

<p>I think the key difference is this: the first group of statements are driven by a desire for attention. The second group are driven by what is popularly known as passion.</p>

<p>The word passion is a misnomer. It reminds me of somebody watching motivational speeches on YouTube, getting ‚Äúfired up‚Äù, working for 2 hours on a project and then never again.</p>

<p>Compulsion is a more accurate term for what I‚Äôm describing. There are people who create and create and create and seem to be interested in everything. It‚Äôs as if they are possessed. Socrates himself claimed to have a daimonion, a ‚Äúdivine something‚Äù that compelled him to do what he did. The Iliad begins with the speaker of the poem invoking the Muse, asking her to sing the epic <strong>through</strong> him.</p>

<p>But that type of attribution that is doing these people a disservice. For all their creativity they are incredibly human. They‚Äôve honed their ability with dedication, discipline and sacrifice. They only seem to draw their ideas out of thin air because they‚Äôve come up with so many ideas before, both good and bad. They create beautiful, useful, and profitable things again and again because they‚Äôve put the legwork in.</p>

<p><strong>I absolutely believe we all have this capability within us.</strong></p>

<p>Often however, we don‚Äôt feel compelled to create, much less do anything. We get excited about ideas, and think they are dumb a week later. We don‚Äôt feel inspired in our monotonous daily routines.</p>

<p>So how do we become curious? Creative? <strong>Compelled?</strong></p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a story from my own life:</p>

<p>I did an informatics degree in college to make myself more ‚Äúemployable‚Äù. It was mostly a slog.</p>

<p>On a whim I took Japanese Religions to satisfy a requirement.</p>

<p>The class was a breath of fresh air. The professor, Jane Law, weaved psychology, philosophy, history, and mythology together to tell stories. That was it. Suddenly, I was interested in all those topics.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life, I looked forward to going to class.</p>

<p>I had no idea that I‚Äôd be interested, until I was.</p>

<p>Everybody will tell you what is worth learning and what is not. Well-intentioned friends and family members. ‚ÄúThought leaders‚Äù. Ted Talks. CEOs. Social media. Books.</p>

<p><strong>But only you will know what you actually like.</strong></p>

<p>Because when you know you know. It‚Äôll hit you like a rock and your brain will explode when the neurons are suddenly all going off at the same time and you realize you‚Äôve been starved, like a traveler in a barren desert seeing water for the very first time.</p>

<p>So if you don‚Äôt like a book that has rave reviews, put it down. Life is too short.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt care about the opinions that social media is constantly churning out, delete the whole thing. Life is too short.</p>

<p>If you aren‚Äôt interested in the ‚Äòprestigious‚Äô career that all your friends are going into, do something else. Life is too short.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll realize most of these things were about attention-seeking, anyways.</p>

<p>And people forget what they were paying attention to 10 minutes ago.</p>

<p>So explore your natural interests. I don‚Äôt know what they are. Nobody else you talk to will know what they are.</p>

<p>You might not know what your natural interests are at all. If that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôm jealous of you. This is the best part. This is the part where you read as much as possible in any topic. Where you go to plays, museums, meetups, whatever catches your eye. Where you dive a bit deeper into anything that makes you the tiniest bit curious.</p>

<p>Because something will click. It always does.</p>
