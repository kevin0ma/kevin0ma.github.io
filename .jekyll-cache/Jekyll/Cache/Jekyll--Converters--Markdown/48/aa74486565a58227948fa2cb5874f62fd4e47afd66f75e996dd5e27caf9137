            Hi, my name is Kevin. I live in NYC and I <a class="underline black" href="/drawing/">like to draw.</a>
            <br /><br />
            After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in Information Science, I <a class="underline black" href="/vignettes/">hitchhiked</a> across the United States and worked odd jobs for two years.
            <br /><br /> 
            One of those jobs was being a <a class="underline black" href="/streetart/">street artist</a>.
            <br /><br /> After that, I joined <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> as the Lead Product Designer.
            <br /><br /> Today, I do brand &amp; product consulting through my studio.
            <br /><br />
            Good design is a revenue multiplier. That's as true for Fortune 500s as it is for Mom-and-Pop shops.
