I"8<p>At the beginning of this year, I found myself hundreds of miles from home, in a strange neighborhood. It was the first night of a hitchhiking trip across the country, and I was looking for a place to roll out my sleeping bag.</p>

<p>The LA lights twinkled in the distance as dusk fell.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I was in Jane Law’s cozy office. I had taken a great course with her a previous semester, and I wanted to let her to know how much I had enjoyed it. My days in Ithaca were numbered, and I needed closure.</p>

<p>“So, what do you want to do with your life?” She asks.</p>

<p>“I want to be a designer.”</p>

<p>“OK. What else?”</p>

<p>As we talked, the shadows in the room become elongated and formless. I realized that while I had studied fairly hard over the past 4 years, I hadn’t done much thinking for myself at all.</p>

<p>She tells me to try going away for a while.</p>

<p>I walk faster now. The pale stucco houses stretch on. Their shadows are long and tangled, and soon they melt into the rest of the night.</p>

<p>I curse myself for my naivety. For thinking that this would be easy.</p>

<p>It’s dark when I spot a ladder going up the side of an empty office building. I climb up and throw my things in a pile. I crawl into the sleeping bag, and look up into the boundless black blue sky.</p>

<p>Who still hitchhikes?</p>

<p>It turns out there’s a sprawling road subculture. Like any subculture it comes in many flavors that weave and blend together.</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel like a tourist, and that’s probably what I am. Maybe I’ll go home afterwards and write a blog post or two about my experience, and then fill it with blurry phone photos.</p>

<p>Danny is something else completely. With the patchwork pants, mutton chops, and crazy ‘fro, he looks as if he was spit out by a desert hippie commune and then decided not to go home. And that was 2 years ago. He busks to pay the way. He’s indignant at people who admonish him to “get a job”. He’s nothing but friendly to other travelers.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Maine.” He says.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I’m from San Diego originally, and it’s the farthest from San Diego there is.”</p>

<p>He’s tried, but he’s never made it. He feels like this one is the time though.</p>

<p>100 miles out of Phoenix, Andrew stops at a Wendy’s to buy us burgers. He’s been driving for about 2 hours. I am ravenous. I wolf my Son of Baconator down.</p>

<p>Andrew is a Jehovah’s Witness. He made it known at the start. He also made it known that we didn’t have to talk about it. Aware of discomfort that comes with the door-to-door evangelism, he’s simultaneously eager to talk about his faith, and restrained by his own social graces from doing so.</p>

<p>We stop and pick up two more people: an old rancher and a young hitchhiker. He extends the same muted religious enthusiasm to them.</p>

<p>He drops me off at Arizona State University, because I don’t know another landmark in the city. He gives me 5 dollars.</p>

<p>I have a freelance job as a web developer. Simple web applications that I work on whenever I have wifi.</p>

<p>One time I’m camped on the highway. McDonald’s parking lot. They have the best wifi.</p>

<p>As I work, huge freight trucks scream past on the highway outside.</p>

<p>It is very weird and perverse: a guy is lying on his stomach in a sleeping bag staring at a glowing screen next to the highway. A lantern in pitch black.</p>

<p>I do not see the irony at the time: I left home to do exactly what I did at home, only without a roof covering my head.</p>

<p>I wanted to see the US, as much of it as I could, before I started working in earnest.</p>

<p>I was chasing a bunch of clichés for sure: adventure and freedom and friendship and love among them.</p>

<p>Just a kid who spent too much time reading Japanese comics about pirates.</p>

<p>And I was seeking a resolution to the frustration I had bottled up towards my schooling.</p>

<p>As time went on, I slowly accepted that the faults of my institutions were really my own. Just reflected across the aisle.</p>

<p>I worked a couple of jobs along the way: waiter, barista, busser, food prep, delivery boy. I got a temporary place in a few cities. I scrubbed floors and toilets at midnight. I’d look at the black and white floor tiles and get the vague feeling that once upon a time I had been a student but that was now a very long time ago.</p>

<p>Some people were puzzled when I told them what I had studied. I’d say I liked being around food. And stuff.</p>

<p>It’s been months since the first night in California. The sun is coming down, and I can see the downtown lights of Austin. I’m elated, mostly to see my good friend Sam.</p>

<p>There’s so much I want to tell him.</p>
