<p>Hollywood is known for rampant sexism in its movies. Without data however, itâ€™s all rhetoric. We wanted to paint an objective picture of what the gender gap really looked like.</p>

<p>We chose words of dialogue spoken by either gender as a metric of a filmâ€™s gender learnings (inspired largely by the <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdel test</a>). Data was collected on 1000 of IMDBâ€™s top movies of the past 10 years with Pythonâ€™s Beautiful Soup library. Our team then built the visualization with D3.js. I worked on programming and information design.</p>

<p>We were mainly interested in:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The gender skew of movies over time.</li>
  <li>Whether or not the filmsâ€™ key creative roles had an effect on the gender of the movie.</li>
</ol>
