This is part II of the hitchhiking series.

Part I is here.

I've drawn portraits for people on the street on two occasions.

The first time was while hitchhiking through Phoenix. I was struck by the idea when I saw a large piece of cardboard. I spent an hour drawing passer-bys faces and then wrote PORTRAITS: $10. I waited for half an hour, drew the portrait of a very nice lady, and then moved on.

The other time was across a three-week period when I landed in Boston after the trip was over.

I'll be talking about the second time in this post.
