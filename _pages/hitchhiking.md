    Earlier this year, I found myself hundreds of miles from home, in a strange neighborhood. It was the first night of a hitchhiking trip across the country, and I was looking for a place to roll out my sleeping bag.

    I would end up riding with ladies on their way to church at a casino. Self proclaimed wooks obsessed with The Alchemist. A middle aged man who had quit the video game industry after 25 years to do "something else".

    For one, I'm privileged in ways that a lot of people aren't: a college degree, parents willing to help out with a bill or two, and I don't trip racial prejudice alarms when I appear by the side of the road.

    Every few days or so I would hunker down in a McDonald's rest booth and do the side job that sustained my decadent traveling - a small coding gig. A far cry from Kerouac's free-spirited adventures, but hey, that's a different life.

    But really, I was just glad to have a hot shower and go grocery shopping.
