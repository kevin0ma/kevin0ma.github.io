    I'm a designer and developer in NYC, originally from Beijing. <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/illo/">I like to draw.</a>
    <br><br>
    After graduating from Cornell University, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked</a> across America and worked odd jobs for a year.
    <br><br> 
    Afterwards, I was a freelance <a class="underline black" href="https://research.cornell.edu">software developer</a> and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
    <br><br>
    In 2018, I joined <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> as a full-time designer, because I wanted to work on longer term projects, and see how systems and culture were built from within an organization.
    <br><br>
    I like to work with companies who prioritize user research and a lean development process. 
    <br><br>
    I like to work with stakeholders who have strong domain expertise and business-ethics.
