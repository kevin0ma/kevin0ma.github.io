    <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns w-100"><p class="mt0-ns f3 lh-copy"> I'm a product designer in New York, originally from Beijing. After graduating from Cornell University, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked across America and worked odd jobs</a> for a year.
    
    <br><br> Afterwards, I was a <a class="underline black" href="https://research.cornell.edu">contract software developer</a> and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
    <br><br>
  I made the jump to full-time at <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> because I wanted to work on longer-term projects, as well as build process and culture within a smaller organization. I’ve since gravitated towards product design because it involves the areas I’m most interested in: product strategy and definition, design as a business driver, and research.
<br><br>
   
I enjoy working with companies who prioritize user research supported by a lean development process. I’m especially drawn to projects whose stakeholders have strong self-awareness, domain expertise, and business ethics.<br><br> I'm pretty friendly. Feel free to drop me a line:
