    <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns w-100"><p class="mt0-ns f3 lh-copy"> I'm a product designer living in Brooklyn and working in Manhattan. I grew up in Beijing.
<br><br>
I graduated from Cornell in 2017 with a degree in Information Science, after designing for a couple of teams - HTC, IBM, research labs and startups. 
<br><br>
    After graduation I spent the better part of a year <a class="underline black" href=" {{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiking</a> across America and working odd jobs.
<br><br>
    I worked as a <a class="underline black" href="https://hr.cornell.edu">freelance</a> <a class="underline black" href="https://ras.research.cornell.edu/RDHR/">web</a> <a class="underline black" href="https://research.cornell.edu/research-division/">developer</a> for a while, and made the jump to Canary because I wanted to work on longer-term projects with a more meaningful impact on people’s day to day. I’ve since gravitated towards product design (with an emphasis on mobile) because it involves the areas I’m most interested in: product strategy and direction, interaction and visual design, research and testing, and development.
