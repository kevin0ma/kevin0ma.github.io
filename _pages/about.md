            Hi, my name is Kevin. I live in NYC and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/drawing/">I enjoy drawing.</a>
            <br><br>
            After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in Information Science, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked</a> across the United States and worked odd jobs for two years.
            <br><br> 
            One of those jobs was being a <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
            <br><br> After that, I joined <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> as the Lead Product Designer.
            <br><br> Today, I do brand & product consulting through my studio practice. 
            <br><br>
            Good design is revenue. That's as true for Fortune 500s as it is for Mom-and-Pop shops.
