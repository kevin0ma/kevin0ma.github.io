    I'm a designer in New York, originally from Beijing. 
    <br><br>
    After graduating from Cornell University, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked</a> across America and worked odd jobs for a year.
    <br><br> 
    Afterwards, I was a <a class="underline black" href="https://research.cornell.edu">freelance software developer</a> and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
    <br><br>
    In 2018, I joined <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> as a Product Designer because I wanted to work on projects for a longer term, and build culture from within an organization.
    <br><br>
    I enjoy working with companies who prioritize user research supported by a lean development process. I'm especially drawn to projects whose stakeholders have strong self-awareness and business ethics.
