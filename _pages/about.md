    Hi, my name is Kevin. I'm live in NYC and am originally from Beijing. <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/illo/">I enjoy drawing.</a>
    <br><br>
    After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in Information Science, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked</a> across America and worked odd jobs for a year.
    <br><br> 
    After that, I was a freelance software developer and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
    <br><br>
    Then, I joined <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> as a full-time designer.
    <br><br>
    Today, I do embedded design consulting for good people. It's important for me to work with teams that have strong domain knowledge and strong business integrity.
