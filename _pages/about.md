    <div class="fn fl-ns w-50-ns w-100"><p class="mt0-ns f3 lh-copy"> I'm a product designer and software developer living in Brooklyn. After graduating from Cornell University, I <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/vignettes/">hitchhiked across America and worked odd jobs</a> for a year.
<br><br>
  Afterwards, I was a <a class="underline black" href="https://hr.cornell.edu">freelance</a> <a class="underline black" href="https://bokchoybrothers.com">web</a> <a class="underline black" href="https://research.cornell.edu">developer</a> and <a class="underline black" href="{{site.baseurl}}/streetart/">street artist</a>.
  <br><br>
  I made the jump to full-time at <a class="underline black" href="https://canary.is/how-it-works/">Canary</a> because I wanted to work on longer-term projects with a more meaningful impact on people’s day to day. I’ve since gravitated towards product design (with an emphasis on mobile) because it involves the areas I’m most interested in: product strategy and direction, interaction and visual design, research and testing, and development.
<br><br>
    I try to make <a class="underline black" href="http://yubinma.tumblr.com"> something new</a> every day.
