I didn’t grow up around the advent of personal computing—I was a bit (read as: 20 years) late. But I sure wish I did. There’s something very earnest to me about old computer interfaces. I’m the hugest sucker for vicarious nostalgia.

And Mac Paint is the bee’s knees.

They cannot know who I am, inside.

Some people start writing code by the time they're 8. They can tell you stories of their dads bringing home Commodore 128s, showing them BASIC, or Scratch, or Python, or whatever the hell dads and moms show their kids nowadays. They latch right on. They write games. They spend after school at the computer lab. They write their own compilers.

I am not these people. Learning to code was very painful for me. It wasn't until after much sweat and blood had been shed, that I felt like I had stumbled upon something incredible.

Patterns draw me in because they tell stories of the mundane. They speak of everyday life and its routines.

Guess the ending.

I hope we'll play catch in space.
